Twitter's {searchTerms}
===================

Visiting Twitter with Google Chrome can be a pain. Twitter's "{searchTerms}" page is often displayed when you just want to get to its home page. 

If you find it annoying too, just install this little Chrome extension. With it, whenever the "{searchTerms}" page would be displayed, the home page is displayed instead.

**The fastest way to install this extension is by going through Google's Play store:**
