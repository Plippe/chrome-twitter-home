chrome_twitter_home
===================

Visiting Twitter with Google Chrome can be a pain. The "{searchTerms}" page is often displayed when you just want to get to the home page. If you find it annoying too just install this little Chrome extension. With it, the "{searchTerms}" page will never be displayed again.
